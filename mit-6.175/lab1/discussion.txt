Q1: How many gates does your one-bit multiplexer use?
    The 5-bit multiplexer?
    Write down a formula for the number of gates in an N-bit multiplexer. (2 Points)
A1: 4
    20
    4 * N.

Q2: Assume a single full adder requires 5 gates. How many gates does the 8-bit ripple-carry adder require?
    How many gates does the 8-bit carry-select adder require? (2 Points)
A2: 40
    84

Q3: Assume a single full adder requires A time unit to compute its outputs once all its inputs are valid and a mux requires M time unit to compute its output. 
    In terms of A and M, how long does the 8-bit ripple-carry adder take?
    How long does the 8-bit carry-select adder take? (2 Points)
A3: 8A
    4A + M.

Q4: Optional: How long did you take to work on this lab?
